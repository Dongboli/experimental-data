## 

This dataset is for the manuscript: 'Corridor quality buffers extinction under extreme droughts in experimental metapopulations' which has been accepted by Ecology & Evolution. 

Please cite the original paper for this dataset. 

##

This data contain three files: 'Extinction_time', 'total_abun', and 'Varability_abun'. 

'Extinction_time' is to measure when the populations in the patches in a landscape become extinct. Time to extinction is recorded as the mid point of the week. 

'total_abun' is to measure the changes in the total  abundance of each metapopulation over time. 
'Varability_abun' is the standard deviation of patch abundance, which was measured over time. 

###

Id: microcosm id

Corridor_quality: good vs. poor

Drought_severity: slowdrying - weak; fastdrying - strong

Increase_patch: i.e. increase in drought patches, fastincrease vs. slowincrease

Extinc_time: time of metapopulation extinction (weeks)

Week: the week when microcosms were sampled (experiment started from week1)

Count: total metapopulation abundance

Variability: the standard deviation of patch abundance
